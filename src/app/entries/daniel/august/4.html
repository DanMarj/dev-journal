<h1>August 4</h1>

<p>
    Here is the first entry. As of now the entries are html files, not sure if that will change.
    The author of the entry is the parent folder. I think this is a little cleaner than using date
    as the parent.
</p>

<p>
    I'll use the entries for now as a journal of work planned and design decisions made. As far as
    inspiration for the UI, I plan on looking at Wealthsimple's browser version here. In my view it
    is very clean and sort of the perfect example of the modern UI I want to emulate. I like the 
    idea of a large, simple, eye-catching graphic being the first thing seen on the page. If this
    dev journal's purpose is to highlight my coding effort, then I'd like to use my Github 
    contribution graph in the place of the total value graph Wealthsimple uses.
</p>

<p>
    As far as planned work - first get the components to display the critical info - the journal 
    entries, the header, the side bar with more general info - set up, then deal with styling,
    pagination, access to other projects, etc, later. Far further down the line is thinking about
    hosting, accessibility, at some point the projects list should be served by a true backend and
    not staticly included, but all that is "cross that bridge when we get there".

    And of course, anything planned is subject to change based on what catches my interest, lol.
    This project is to demonstrate software engineering, yes, but I also want to enjoy myself.
