<h1>August 6th</h1>

<p>
    This is the second entry in the dev journal.
</p>

<p>
    Sort of started doing the ground work for the components. Added the component for the entry list
    today. It doesn't like... work... will deal with the finnicky stuff tomorrow, first time setting
    up the InnerHTML inside a component. I'm also storing which dates have entries in a .json that
    I'm manually keeping updated, as I add entries. Kind of a scuffed solution but it seems like
    Angular is not set up to read through the contents of a folder generally, you can only fetch
    specific files with the httpClient. I'll look into it more later.
</p>

<p>
    Up next is maybe making them prettier, maybe adding the call to Github API. I also want to code
    a chessboard at some point. I am interested in chess engines, Stockfish in particular, and it'd
    be nice to have the code for the board in place if I ever start looking at that stuff.
</p>

<p>
    Some other stuff on the docket:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Testing</li>
    <li>Cleaner styling</li>
    <li>Connect to the github api</li>
    <li>Accessibility, further down the line</li>
    <li>A true backend - don't even know how I'll APPROACH that</li>
    <li>Hosting / Deploying</li>
    <li>Simple animation, make the webpage feel more dynamic</li>
    <li>Pagination, sorting, filtering for the entries</li>
    <li>Other interesting side projects, be it research or just things I've made</li>
    <li>
        Fix file structure... This isn't really an AI, but something I'll continue to revisit,
        iteratively improve, so on.
    </li>
</ul>
