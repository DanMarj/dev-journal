    Didn't really commit today, so here's a journal entry to update on what I'm doing. I've been
    working on just getting a chessboard working that only accepts valid moves. For now I'm
    writing that in a separate Angular app, I'll link the repo here once I commit it. I may end up
    having that be a page on this website, idk. I'll decide in the future.
