# DevJournal

The point of this dev journal is to stay in the practice of programming. It's an opportunity and a single location to see all projects and areas of interest I'm exploring.
Those projects might be low level AI/ML development, web development, game dev, etc. Whatever is interesting.

On top of that, my hope is that it will serve as an entry into my software dev portfolio as well as the place to find the portfolio itself. I'll demonstrate that I am able to build a modern, pretty, easy to use web UI.

I have a number of friends as well who are sort of in a similar position to myself - unemployed but looking for work within software development - who may also contribute. I believe that working collaboratively and publicly on a project like this will do a lot to present us well to potential employers.

Basically this project serves many purposes, but at its core its just a dev journal.
